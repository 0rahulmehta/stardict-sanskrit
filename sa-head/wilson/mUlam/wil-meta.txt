This file describes the coding conventions of the data files.
This file is encoded in utf-8 encoding.

The original digitization is file wil_orig.txt, which is
coded in the cp1252 (windows 1252) encoding,
and is best viewed in a text editor which supports this encoding.
For example, in Emacs, one may use the command
revert-buffer-with-coding-system
and then select cp1252 as the coding.
The internet reference http://www.cp1252.com/ describes this coding system.

The file wil_orig_utf8.txt is a conversion of wil_orig.txt to the
more common utf-8 encoding.
(Nov 14, 2014) The file wil_orig_utf8_slp1.txt contains the same data, but
  has Devanagari coded in SLP1 transliteration.  It is the basis of further
  corrections.

The file wil.txt is also in the utf-8 encoding, and incorporates various
editing changes, such as corrections of typographical errors.

There are several extended ascii codes occurring in wil.txt:
¦  (\u00a6) 44577 := BROKEN BAR
°  (\u00b0)     5 := DEGREE SIGN
²  (\u00b2) 44747 := SUPERSCRIPT TWO
¼  (\u00bc)     1 := VULGAR FRACTION ONE QUARTER
½  (\u00bd)     3 := VULGAR FRACTION ONE HALF
Æ  (\u00c6)    48 := LATIN CAPITAL LETTER AE
æ  (\u00e6)   163 := LATIN SMALL LETTER AE
œ  (\u0153)    54 := LATIN SMALL LIGATURE OE
‘  (\u2018)     8 := LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK
’  (\u2019)     7 := RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK
“  (\u201c)     2 := LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK
”  (\u201d)     2 := RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK


The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{#X#}  200898 : {#X#} devanagari text, coded with HK
                Nov 14, 2014. X is now in SLP1 in wil.txt
{%X%}   10790 : italic text
{@X@}   10790 : bold text
{??}        1 : unreadable text

The following  <x> type tags are found in wil.txt:
<H>  47 : letter breaks
<pic> 1 : picture
<g>X</g> 22 :  Greek
<A></A> 4 :  (Arabic alphabet)

Page breaks are coded as [PageX], where X is page number
from 1 to 982.  Each page has two columns, but the column breaks are
not specified in the digitization.


The lines of the digitization generally represent 'sections' of the text; the
actual line-breaks of the text are not coded.

Headword coding is exemplified by: .{#a#}¦
The general form is .{#X#}¦
where X (key1) is coded in Harvard-Kyoto transliteration.
The headwords are ordered according to Sanskrit alphabet ordering.
Nov 14, 2014. X is now in SLP1 transliteration.

Some Sanskrit in the text appears in the European Indological form, which is
coded in wil.txt with the the AS (Anglicized Sanskrit) coding.

The general AS scheme, as described in CDSL.pdf, uses Latin alphabetical
letters 'x (a-z,A-Z), possibly with suffixed numbers; the letter-number
combinations are, in the general scheme:
x1 = macron
x2 = dot below
x3 = dot above
x4 = accent aigu
x5 = tilde
x6 = dash below
x7 = umlaut
x10 = circonflex (hat)
x11 = accent grave

Here are the characters that occur in wil.txt in this coding,
with their approximate frequency.  

a1     1 := ā  (\u0101)  LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH MACRON
a10     7 := â  (\u00e2)  LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH CIRCUMFLEX
A4  1765 := Á (\u00c1)  LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH ACUTE
a4  4038 := á(\u00e1) LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH ACUTE
a7     7 := ä  (\u00e4)  LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS
E4   441 := É  (\u00c9)  LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E WITH ACUTE
e4   702 := é  (\u00e9)  LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE
e7     9 := ë  (\u00eb)  LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH DIAERESIS
I10    66 := Ī  (\u012a)  LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH MACRON
i10    13 := î  (\u00ee)  LATIN SMALL LETTER I WITH CIRCUMFLEX
I12   238 := Ǐ  (\u01cf)  LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH CARON
i12    92 := ǐ  (\u01d0)  LATIN SMALL LETTER I WITH CARON
I4   406 := Í  (\u00cd)  LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH ACUTE
i4   401 := í (\u00ed) LATIN SMALL LETTER I WITH ACUTE
i7    36 := ï  (\u00ef)  LATIN SMALL LETTER I WITH DIAERESIS
O4    28 := Ó  (\u00d3) LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH ACUTE
o4   259 := ó  (\u00f3) LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH ACUTE
o7    27 := ö  (\u00f6)  LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH DIAERESIS
u10     2 := ū  (\u016b)  LATIN SMALL LETTER U WITH MACRON
U4    21 := Ú  (\u00da)  LATIN CAPITAL LETTER U WITH ACUTE
u4   238 := ú (\u00fa) LATIN SMALL LETTER U WITH ACUTE
u7     7 := ü  (\u00fc)  LATIN SMALL LETTER U WITH DIAERESIS

Note:  Several consonants appear in the scan with a trailing apostrophe (
  sometimes printed as an 'acute accent' over the letter).  The digitization
  sometimes represents such a consonant X as X4 and somtimes as X'.  
  The 'change_01' update changes all such consonant X4 to X'.
