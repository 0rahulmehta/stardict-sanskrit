
This is babylon, bgl, stardict files of spokensanskrit.de

with .bgl dictionary, we can have colors, and  formatting. And golden dict
officially supports bgl files on both desktop and mobile.

AS WE ARE USING .BABYLON EXTENSION FILES TO CREATE STARDICT FILES,
.GLS IS FOR CREATING BABYLON .BGL FILES

.gls and .babylon  files are same, but .gls contains  tags for formatting.
So if you want to remove those tags run rmtags.sh , and then  it is 
stardict compiler compatable  babylon file.

as spokensanskrit neatly orders with priority, and even gives results
if the search word is a part of any sentence, or word. and that too with
correct priorities, and much advanced algorithm. So  golden dict
search feature, we cannot actually customise, or give priorities
or tabulate relevent results and etymologically related results too.
 so for that reason, first created search result from 
spokensanskrit,, and created content thus,,  and amolgamated with goldendict search terms.

So now we can get completely same essense of spokensanskrit, and dispay too.
along with  multi word  results from goldendict. Use double click feature, as it
is too convinient in this case.

And it can ussed as nice brigdge between all dictionaries, as it lists all possible
same meaning words  without description at one  place, and again it is both sa-En and En-sa
search also supported. 

And if you have babylon10 installed in your windows, as bgl is avialable, you can use
it to fully utilise babylon translation algorithms, and even it's integration with MS office.
And instant popups everywhere, and all from it. But their software is propriarity.

Some random search words to give an idea :

desired
red
rudhira
having
mRtajAta
trunk
