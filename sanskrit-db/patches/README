Here, atleast weeekly one patch with new version will be added, in table format.
And that patch will be appended to sanskrit.table file, and then it will be
re-sorted. and dupilcates will be removed  if any. So if we want any additions,
instead of appending it to main file, and  messing with order, we will add here.
