Namaste all

This project ims to create opensource database of parallel sanskrit to english
pin point translations, so that it can be used any where.

all data sorted in a table file, sanskrit.table , 
format is like

│devanagari_word{synonym}│Itrans{itrans  of synonym}│bhashabhag_or_gender_like_details│English_translations

example:

│ॐ { ओंकार }│OM  { oMkAra }│phrase│Om  [ Aum, Omkara ]

if any more details are necesary  then additional columns will be added if specified.


And any additions to this file will be done in patches folder,
in patches folder, weeekly one file will be added, and we  can add all 
our additions to that file for that week, and then append it to original
table file, and re-sort it. So don't edit in sanskrit.table file.

directories will be created for every book that can give considerable amount of
data, and they will be cleaned, and select only pin point translation with out description
and then format it.. all will be done in corresponding folder, if it is saticifying,
copy that to patches folder, and append from there.

finally in sql folder, the databases created from these tables will be stored,


Suggest any betterment in formatting or,sources, plan, so that it will be easy for all.
