This file describes the coding conventions of the data files.
This file is encoded in utf-8 encoding.

The original digitization is file bor_orig.txt, which is
coded in the cp1252 (windows 1252) encoding,
and is best viewed in a text editor which supports this encoding.
For example, in Emacs, one may use the command
revert-buffer-with-coding-system
and then select cp1252 as the coding.
The internet reference http://www.cp1252.com/ describes this coding system.

The file bor_orig_utf8.txt is a conversion of bor_orig.txt to the
more common utf-8 encoding.
(Nov 26, 2014) The file bor_orig_utf8_slp1.txt contains the same data, but
  has Devanagari coded in SLP1 transliteration.  It is the basis of further
  corrections.
The file bor.txt is also in the utf-8 encoding, and incorporates various
editing changes, such as corrections of typographical errors.

There are several extended ascii codes occurring in bor.txt:
¦  (\u00a6)    53 := BROKEN BAR
§  (\u00a7)    16 := SECTION SIGN
²  (\u00b2) 15871 := SUPERSCRIPT TWO
³  (\u00b3) 27205 := SUPERSCRIPT THREE
½  (\u00bd)     1 := VULGAR FRACTION ONE HALF
¾  (\u00be)     1 := VULGAR FRACTION THREE QUARTERS
Æ  (\u00c6)     8 := LATIN CAPITAL LETTER AE
æ  (\u00e6)     1 := LATIN SMALL LETTER AE
Œ  (\u0152)     4 := LATIN CAPITAL LIGATURE OE
œ  (\u0153)     2 := LATIN SMALL LIGATURE OE
‘  (\u2018)    65 := LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK
’  (\u2019)    65 := RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK
“  (\u201c)   262 := LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK
”  (\u201d)   262 := RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK

…  (\u2026) 89303 := HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS  (These are markup - prob. unneeded)
            (Replaced by space character in bor.txt by change_01)


The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{#X#}  84595  : {#X#} devanagari text, coded with HK
                Nov 26, 2014  X is in SLP1 transliteration
{@X@}  25623  : bold text.  Also, used to delimit headword
{%X%}  18716  : italic text 
{??} or {?}     221  : unreadable text
           Note: Oct 6, 2014.  All unreadbles corrected by
	     Sampada Savardekar.

The following  <x> type tags are found in bor.txt:
<P>  used only in headword designation

Page breaks are coded as [PagePPP],
where PPP goes from 001 to 772.

The lines of the digitization generally represent 'sections' of the text; the
actual line-breaks of the text are often indicated by a vertical bar '|'.

Headword coding is exemplified by: <P>{@BRACE@}
The general form is <P>{@X@}  where X is in capital letters.


The headwords are ordered according to English alphabet ordering.


Some Sanskrit in the text appears in the European Indological form, which is
coded in bor.txt with the the AS (Anglicized Sanskrit) coding.

The general AS scheme, as described in CDSL.pdf, uses Latin alphabetical
letters 'x (a-z,A-Z), possibly with suffixed numbers; the letter-number
combinations are, in the general scheme:
x1 = macron
x2 = dot below
x3 = dot above
x4 = accent aigu
x5 = tilde
x6 = dash below
x7 = umlaut
x10 = circonflex (hat)
x11 = accent grave

Here are the characters that occur in bor.txt in this coding,
with their approximate frequency.  

A1     3 := Ā  (\u0100)  LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH MACRON
a1   492 := ā  (\u0101)  LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH MACRON
a7     1 := ä  (\u00e4)  LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS
d2    25 := ḍ  (\u1e0d)  LATIN SMALL LETTER D WITH DOT BELOW
i1    53 := ī  (\u012b)  LATIN SMALL LETTER I WITH MACRON
n2    74 := ṇ  (\u1e47)  LATIN SMALL LETTER N WITH DOT BELOW
o1     3 := ō  (\u014d)  LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH MACRON
s2     8 := ṣ  (\u1e63)  LATIN SMALL LETTER S WITH DOT BELOW
S4    94 := Ś  (\u015a)  LATIN CAPITAL LETTER S WITH ACUTE
s4    39 := ś  (\u015b)  LATIN SMALL LETTER S WITH ACUTE
t2    20 := ṭ  (\u1e6d)  LATIN SMALL LETTER T WITH DOT BELOW
u1    18 := ū  (\u016b)  LATIN SMALL LETTER U WITH MACRON
